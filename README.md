# ðŸŽ¯ Pathfinding
Pathfinding is a graphical Java application for visualizing several pathfinding algorithms.

### Included Algorithms

- âœ… [A*][A*]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [BFS][BFS]: explore nearest successors first, then widen the search.
- [DFS][DFS]: explore a graph by going as far as possible, then backtrack.
- [Dijkstra][Dijkstra]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- [Edmonds Karp][Edmonds Karp]: find the maximum flow in a weighted graph.
- [Fringe][Fringe]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [IDA*][IDA*]: explore longer and longer paths in a weighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.
- [IDDFS][IDDFS]: explore longer and longer paths in an unweighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.
### Features
- Find the shortest path (not always) between two nodes in the grid.
