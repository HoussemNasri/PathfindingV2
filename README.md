# ðŸŽ¯ Pathfinding
Pathfinding is a graphical Java application for visualizing many pathfinding algorithms, Implemented using the MVP architecture pattern

### Included Algorithms

- âœ… [A*][A*]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- âœ… [Dijkstra][Dijkstra]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- âœ… [DFS][DFS]: explore a graph by going as far as possible, then backtrack.
- [BFS][BFS]: explore nearest successors first, then widen the search.
- [Edmonds Karp][Edmonds Karp]: find the maximum flow in a weighted graph.
- [Fringe][Fringe]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [IDA*][IDA*]: explore longer and longer paths in a weighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.
- [IDDFS][IDDFS]: explore longer and longer paths in an unweighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.

### Features
- Visualize more than 5 different algorithms
- Switch between different themes and colors
- Add/Remove obstacles
- Relocate source and destination
- Simple Navigation
- Tweak the visualization speed easily
- Examine algorithms heuristics for each node
- Step In/Out the algorithm procedure 
- [TODO] Generate perfect maze using more than 4 algorithms
- [TODO] Create custom themes easily
